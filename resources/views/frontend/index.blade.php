At the RRF, we believe that all players should be able to enjoy great MILSIM gameplay, which is why we offer a public server, running our full modpack. Of course, no ARMA unit is complete without regular operations and events, so we schedule fortnightly operations as well as squad events twice a week.

                                    11Bs make up the bulk of the RRF's fighting force. Well trained in open warfare, out 11Bs are deployed across a variety of elements, including Airborne, Air Assualt, Mechanized, Motorized and Amphibious groups.

                                    Many 11Bs choose never to progress further into the unit as they find that the role provides a great all round experience that is not overly time consuming.

                                <p>
                                    Our 11Bs are trained to some of the highest standards in the ARMA verse to show teamwork and discipline, whilst not operating at a level that requires enthusiast level time commitments.

                                    11Bs are essential to completing any objective that the RRF is assigned, normally utilizing firepower and overwhelming force tactics to complete their objective in coordination with other elements.
